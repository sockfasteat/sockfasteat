### hello ^_^

software engineer with a tic for well crafted code. while my focus lies in writing ui with react, i thoroughly enjoy optimizing for web performance & developer workflow efficiency.

i've watched [the last dance](https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144) ~twice during shelter in place and~ ~~im probably going to watch it again.~~ ~im currently on my third watch.~ three times during quarantine. i don't even normally watch basketball or sports in general. it's just so good. im an enjoyer of making a pourover coffee, some fresh air, and maintaining way too many spotify playlists.

my website will better capture my being (only if you're interested! it's also not fully built out yet, but it's the aesthetic i'm going for)

cheers,
charlie
