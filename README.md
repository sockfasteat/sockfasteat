### hello ^_^

im charlie. i like writing everything in lowercase. im a software engineer with a tic for well crafted code. while my focus lies in writing ui with react, i have an obsession with optimizing for web performance, so i'm open to working on any type of solution to achieve responsive apps. i understand that security and accessibility come before 

i've watched the last dance twice during shelter in place and im probably going to watch it again. it's so good. 

i also have an obession with systems and habits - from writing a scalable weightlifting program (that actually started as an excel sheet in college) to meal prepping solid food to trying to be as efficient as possible in my day to day work. 

hit the dms

cheers
