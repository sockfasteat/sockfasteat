### hello ^_^

software engineer with a tic for well crafted code. while my focus lies in writing ui with react, i have an obsession with optimizing for web performance, so i'm open to working on any type of solution to achieve a responsive experience. i understand that security and accessibility are first class priorities. it's kind of like doing homework before going outside to play, as mother would say.

i've watched [the last dance](https://www.netflix.com/title/80203144) ~twice during shelter in place and~ ~~im probably going to watch it again.~~ ~im currently on my third watch.~ three times during quarantine. i don't even normally watch basketball or sports in general. it's just so good. i'm an enjoyer of the outdoors, some fresh air, typing in lowercase, and a cold beer.

my website will better capture my being (only if you're interested!!)

hit the dms

cheers,
charlie
